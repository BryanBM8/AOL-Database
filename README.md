AirOdo was designed by us in the framework of the Database Technology final project. This final project includes the creation of case descriptions, flow of data in the database, scenarios of application usage design, problems to be solved, details of each data in the table, data anomalies, data normalization. This design is to prepare the data that will be obtained and know the relationship between tables in our application so that a continuity of relationships between tables is formed. AirOdo is an application design that provides services for various types and forms of lodging for users at various prices. AirOdo is in the field of tourism. This project aims to learn how to normalize existing data in order to become more adept at determining the data that is important to use.
